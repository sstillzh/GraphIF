As an intelligent assistant, your primary objective is to analyze and propose a current action based on the user instruction and the extracted information in a multi-turn dialogue scenario. 
<system>
OBJECTIVE:
Our idea is to use a directed relation graph to model the relation between different turns of dialogue.We need to gradually extract the relation between the current instruction and different historical conversations, one relation at a time, step by step. Previously, we have obtained the user intention based on the instruction. Now our task is to analyze the user instruction and propose the first action that should be performed next.

List of Actions that can be Selected：

1. **Identify_Global_Constraint**: This indicates that the user instruction serves as a *global constraint*, explicitly applying specific requirements to all subsequent interactions. It must clearly state the conditions that every future response must satisfy. If the constraint applies only to the current response, it is **not** considered a Global Constraint.

2. **Identify_Context-Anchored**: *Context-Anchored* means that the user's instruction is based on content from earlier parts of the dialogue history. Therefore, the relevant contextual reference must be identified first in order to understand and respond appropriately.

3. **Identify_Modify**: *Modify* refers to user instructions that further develop, revise, refine, clarify, or follow up on previous content in a logical manner. It can also refer to new instructions that, while lacking an explicit contextual anchor, clearly build upon the prior conversation. In such cases, the instruction is inherently a continuation or extension of the dialogue, and thus qualifies as a Modify relation. To respond accurately, the system must identify the part of the previous dialogue that aligns with this Modify relation. Modify represents a more advanced form of Context-Anchored, with the key distinction being that it introduces additional or more specific requirements.

4. **New_Topic**:This indicates that the user instruction introduces an entirely new subject that is *not* logically or contextually connected to the prior conversation. The instruction should be interpreted and responded to independently, as the beginning of a new conversational thread.( Be careful when judging New_Topic: only when the user instruction has nothing to do with the historical dialogues, it could be judged as New_Topic.)

5.**Identify_Summary**: This indicates that the user instruction is a summary of the previous dialogues. The system must identify the scope of the previous dialogues that needs to be summarized and generate a summary based on the related content.

6. **Done**: This indicates that all necessary actions have been completed and all relevant information has been successfully extracted or identified (or when answering user instructions, there is no need to extract specific historical information, and the response can be generated directly). The system has finished any required analysis, interpretation, or contextual linking related to the user's instruction. At this point, no further internal processing is needed, and the system is ready to proceed with generating a final response. The *Done* status serves as a clear signal that the input has been fully understood and the dialogue can now transition to output generation.


OUTPUT FORMAT：
You will respond with a JSON object in this format and will not respond to anything else:
{
"rationale": "<Explain the reasons for choosing the corresponding action.>",
"score":<Confidence score, which measures the confidence level of choosing the current action>,
"answer": <the chosen action this time>
}

(Notes on Confidence Score:
    1. If you think the confidence level of the selected action is very high, the score is above 0.8
    2. If you are not completely sure that the selected action is correct, but you are relatively sure, the score is between 0.5-0.8
    3. If you are not sure that the selected action is correct, the score is below 0.5
)

# Demonstration Examples
Example 1:
##### 
instruction: 
Write a short summary based on the Initial content previously provided. Do not include any further explanations or extra output in your response. 

Intention: 
{
  "Intention": "Generate a concise summary based on the previously provided initial content",
  "Constraints": "The summary should be short; do not include any further explanations or extra output"
}


Assistant:
{
"rationale": "The phrase 'based on the Initial content previously provided' explicitly anchors the instruction to prior content in the conversation. This requires identifying the relevant context from earlier dialogue to properly understand and respond, which fits the definition of a Context-Anchored relationship rather than a continuation or refinement.",
"score": 0.95,
"answer": "Identify_Context-Anchored"
}

#####  

Example 2:
##### 
instruction: 
Rewrite it using Luminara's first-person perspective 

Intention: 
{
"Intention": "Rewrite the provided content from Luminara's first-person perspective",
"Constraints": "None"
}


Assistant:
{
"rationale": "The instruction 'Rewrite it using Luminara's first-person perspective' implies a follow-up action that modifies or refines previously provided content. It is a continuation of the dialogue that builds upon earlier context, so the system must identify the relevant previous content to perform the rewrite. This fits the Identify_Modify category as it logically extends and refines earlier conversation.",
"score": 0.9,
"answer": "Identify_Modify"
}



#####  



Example 3: Example of Global Constraint:
##### 
instruction: 
All your responses in the upcoming conversation must be in all lower letters. Keep all your responses under 200 words.

Intention: 
{
"Intention": "Respond to all upcoming queries in lowercase and limit the response length to under 200 words",
"Constraints": "Responses must be in lowercase and should not exceed 200 words"
}


Assistant:
{
"rationale": "The instruction explicitly sets global constraints that must be applied to all subsequent responses in the conversation. This fits the definition of a Global Constraint because it imposes specific rules that affect all future interactions, rather than only the current response.",
"score": 0.95,
"answer": "Identify_Global_Constraint"
}



#####  


Example 4: An example of simply proposing a story--- Execute New_Topic:
##### 
instruction: 
In a bustling city full of lights, creativity, and culture, lived a young woman named Lily who had an eye for fashion and a heart full of passion. From a young age, she was captivated by the way clothing could express identity and emotion. Every weekend, she wandered through local boutiques, fashion outlets, and online platforms, staying up to date with what was hot and what was next.
One afternoon, while browsing a street market, Lily noticed something different—a subtle but growing trend that mixed vintage aesthetics with modern silhouettes. Old-school denim jackets were being paired with sleek, minimalistic trousers; lace blouses from the '70s were styled with bold sneakers and structured handbags. This blend of old and new struck a chord with her. It was more than just a trend—it was a celebration of history and individuality.

Intention: 
{
"Intention": "Provide a narrative about a marketing executive's struggle with stress and his participation in a relaxation-training program, highlighting the positive outcomes and its impact on his mental well-being",
"Constraints": "None"
}

Assistant:
{
"rationale": "The instruction introduces a completely new narrative about Lily and her passion for fashion, which is not connected to any prior conversation. This fits the definition of a New_Topic as it starts a new conversational thread without any contextual ties to previous dialogue.",
"score": 0.98,
"answer": "New_Topic"
}

#####

The above are just examples, the following are the user's instruction
Please strictly follow the above format. Just generate the action,no need to answer the instruction. 

Remember：
1. Comprehensive analysis and consideration of user instruction and user intention when generating actions.
2.Note: Be careful when deciding to take the **Identify_Global_Constraint** action. To be clear: The key meaning of Global Constraint is to specify the constraints that all subsequent instructions must satisfy. If the instruction only proposes a constraint and does not explicitly require that all subsequent instructions must satisfy it, such as 'Limit your descriptions in 15 words.' in Example 5, then the Identify_Global_Constraint action must not be taken.
3. In many cases, correctly answering user instruction requires identifying multiple related conversations in the history, and therefore multiple actions need to be performed. In order to decompose complex problem into simple subtasks, our current task is to output the first action to be taken , and subsequent actions will be identified in subsequent tasks.
4. Please think carefully.
5. Note:Identify_Modify is often misjudged as Identify_Context-Anchored, because Modify is an extension of the Context-Anchored relation. If it is Modify, it must be Context-Anchored. Therefore, do not be conservative when choosing an action. If the current instruction makes a request and has a further meaning in semantics, it can be judged as Identify_Modify.
6.Be careful when using New_Topic. Only when the instruction is a single instruction and has no any connection with the historical dialogue, use New_Topic.
7.To correctly understand our task, we only need to determine the actions that need to be performed, without having to answer the instructions or take the requirements of the instructions. (For example, in Example 11, the instruction requires that all subsequent responses must have two different responses separated by 6 asterisk symbols: ******, which is the constraint that needs to be met when the response is generated. The current task generates an action and does not need to return two answers.)

**Attention**
In order to make the information more condensed and focused while saving context length, the conversation history in example may not the original conversation history, but a summarized conversation history. When identifying actions, pay attention to the semantic associations between dialogues and do not be misled by the fact that the information is summarized rather than the original text.
Let's begin.

Instruction:
{user_instruction}

Intention:

Please make sure that the answer generated is one of Identify_Global_Constraint \ Identify_Context-Anchored \ Identify_Modify \ Identify_Summary \ New_Topic \ Done and do not generate irrelevant answers.
