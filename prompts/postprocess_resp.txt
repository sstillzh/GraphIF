## ANALYSIS & RATIONALE
The initial response already meets most of the extracted constraints:
1. It's written entirely in English (fulfilling the LANGUAGE CONSTRAINT)
2. It presents the analysis from a business analyst's perspective (fulfilling the USER INTENTION constraint)
3. It thoroughly addresses the long-term impacts of digital transformation on SMEs' competitiveness
However, the response doesn't start with the letter 'C' as required by the Global Constraint in this example. Therefore, we need to modify the opening while preserving all the substantive content and maintaining the business analyst perspective.

## FINAL-RESPONSE
**Competitive advantages from digital transformation reshape SMEs' long-term prospects:**  
As a business analyst, I've observed that digital transformation has a profound impact on small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs)' competitiveness in the long term. Here are some key findings:  
1. **Increased agility and adaptability**: Digital transformation enables SMEs to respond quickly to changing market conditions, customer needs, and technological advancements, giving them a competitive edge in a rapidly evolving business environment.
